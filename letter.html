    <h1>Letter to Lachlan ðŸ’Œ</h1>
    <pre>Dear Lachlan,

First of all, I want to say that this letter is not a goodbye. I never thought of it as a real farewell. Iâ€™m sure we will see each other again.

Iâ€™m really happy that I met you. It feels like Iâ€™ve had a wonderful dream. During the time we spent together, I found you to be such an interesting personâ€”never making things awkward, always keeping our conversations going. Please forgive my poor English, as sometimes I couldnâ€™t give you the active responses I wanted, but I truly enjoy listening to your stories. And honestly, you look very charming when you are working!

You said you work very hard, youâ€™re sensible, and sometimes needy, jealous. Iâ€™m glad you shared these sides of yourself with me, but I also see how much effort you put into getting better. I hope that when youâ€™re with me, you donâ€™t feel pressureâ€”I hope what I bring you is happiness.

You always compliment me so openly and it makes me happy. But I rarely compliment you, which makes me feel a little ashamed. Maybe in our time together, youâ€™ve given more than me, and Iâ€™m really grateful for that. I can feel your passion and sincerity, and I think that is what matters most.

You said meeting someone like me is a rarity. But I think itâ€™s because you are good enough that the people you meet are also good hahaha. And most importantly, you are already excellent yourself!

I truly wish you all the best, because you deserve it!

â€” Hongyan Wang</pre>
